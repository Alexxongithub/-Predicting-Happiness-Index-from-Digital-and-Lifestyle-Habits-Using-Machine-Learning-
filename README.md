# -Predicting-Happiness-Index-from-Digital-and-Lifestyle-Habits-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project investigates how digital habits (e.g., screen time and social media usage) and lifestyle behaviors (e.g., sleep quality, exercise frequency, and stress levels) influence mental health and emotional balance.

We trained a Random Forest Regressor on a dataset containing behavioural and lifestyle features. The final model is deployed using FastAPI, and a simple, interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend allows users to input data and receive predictions in real time.
